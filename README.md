# solve-it-ai-applications

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates an application of the SOLVE-IT knowledge base (https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it) as described in Section 5.5 of the paper below:

```Hargreaves, C., van Beek, H., Casey, E., SOLVE-IT: A proposed digital forensic knowledge base inspired by MITRE ATT&CK, Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, Volume 52, Supplement, 2025, 301864, ISSN 2666-2817, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2025.301864```



## Description
It shows how the knowledge base can be used to consider available digital forensic techniques in a structured manner and consider the existing and potential ways in which AI could be used to assist. 

This review uses explicit categories (described below) rather then general ones e.g. high, medium or low. Also note that generic applications such as the use of AI to inform how to perform a technique or explain CLI tool usage are not included.

Categories are:

- Unclassified
- Non AI-based process likely sufficient
- Some application can be evisaged
- In academix work (idea)
- In academic work (implementation)
- In tools

## Details

The details of the review can be found in the releases section as a PDF for now. This will shortly be updated with a code repo that auto-generates the output using the SOLVE-IT repo.
